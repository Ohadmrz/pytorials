# Write a code that receives the year as input and prints whether t
# he year is a leap year or not. To be a leap year,
# the year number must be divisible by four â€“
# except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.
# This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
# 2020, 2024 and 2028 are all leap years.
